##  <strong>1.Compiler and libraties：</strong>
<strong>Question:</strong>how to load the proper compiler for specific tool. Take ncview for example,  both pgi and intel can make ncview work. 
<strong>Response:</strong>
Usually the libraries (such as netcdf, hdf5, etc) are compiled with multiple compilers (such as pgi, intel, gnu). So, load the module for the compiler first and then load other relevant libraries.  <br>

Some clusters (such as NERSC) automatically load correct version of libraries when you swap compiler module (i.e. if you loaded pgi,<br>
 then loaded netcdf, you should get netcdf lib compiled with pgi. Now, if you swap pgi with intel, the netcdf library should also be<br>
 automatically swapped so that you get netcdf with intel).<br>

Bottom line is: the library you are using should be compatible with compiler you are using.<br>


## <strong>1. creating a compset</strong>
- You may follow the changes in this commit
https://github.com/hydrotian/ACME/commit/26e5516fef8d1b1db7f0d08c87fdbe016ee2f2d2 
this was the commit Tony did when he added RM compset
now with current master branch, some files has changed so I wasn't able to make RM and GLB05RM work

-what you can do it to check the working version from add-inundation branch with RM and GLB05RM

-check the files that were modified based on Tony's commit
then translate the changes to current master

## <strong>2. generate new land initial file</strong>
<strong>Problem:</strong> when running E3SM, came into this problem shown in e3sm.log file: <br>
pio_support::pio_die:: myrank=          -1 : ERROR: nf_mod.F90:        1288 : <br>
 NetCDF: Invalid dimension ID or name’<br>
 
<strong>Solution:</strong> generate new land initial file
 
The new land initial file can be generated using “interpinic” tool available in components/clm/tools/clm4_5/interpinic. You have to do the following:<br>

- First, run the case for a short duration (say 1 day) without using an initial condition by setting the following in user_nl_clm:
finidat = ‘’ <br>

The above step would generate a *.clm2.r.*.nc (located in /scratch/run)<br>

- Now use the interpinic tool to remap your old initial condition (alm45_mosart_bgc_crop_noirr_new_spinup_final_v2.clm2.r.2156-01-01-00000.nc) onto the newly created *.clm2.r.*.nc in step-1 via running the following on the compute node:<br>

cd /pic/projects/climate/maoy573/E3SM/components/clm/tools/clm4_5/interpinic<br>
module list:<br>
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:<br>
  1) intel/15.0.1(default) 2) mkl/15.0.1 3) mvapich2/2.1  4) cmake/2.8.12(default)  5) python/2.7.8     7) netcdf/4.3.2(default)<br>
setenv INC_NETCDF /share/apps/netcdf/4.3.2/intel/15.0.1/include<br>
setenv LIB_NETCDF /share/apps/netcdf/4.3.2/intel/15.0.1/lib<br>

./interpinic -i <path-to-old-initial-condition> -o <path-to-new-restart-file><br>

Some notes from NCAR on how to compile interpinic and other related topic are available at <br> http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.2/clm/models/lnd/clm/doc/UsersGuide/x11704.html<br>
