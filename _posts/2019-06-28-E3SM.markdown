## creating a compset
- You may follow the changes in this commit
https://github.com/hydrotian/ACME/commit/26e5516fef8d1b1db7f0d08c87fdbe016ee2f2d2 
this was the commit Tony did when he added RM compset
now with current master branch, some files has changed so I wasn't able to make RM and GLB05RM work

-what you can do it to check the working version from add-inundation branch with RM and GLB05RM

-check the files that were modified based on Tony's commit
then translate the changes to current master
