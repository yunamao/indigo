### 1. export, set和setenv区别：

 export, set and setenv commands are used in UNIX for setting value of a variable or an environment variable.<br>

1. export command is used to for bash shell to export a variable or function to the environment of all the child processes running in the current shell.

2. set and setenv are the c-shell/tc-shell alternatives for setting a local <br>
 variable and environment variable respectively. The set command is used for setting<br>  local variable, setenv is uesd for setting an environment variable.<br> 
<strong>Example:</strong>
 
#set  FILE=”output.txt”<br> 
#echo $FILE<br> 
output.txt<br> 
#tcsh<br> 
#echo $FILE<br> 

#setenv  FILE ”output.txt”<br> 
#echo $FILE<br> 
output.txt<br> 
#tcsh<br> 
#echo $FILE<br> 
output.txt<br> 
### 2. change bash and csh shell in linux：
echo $0：check current shell
input bash will transfer csh to bash, vice versa.
### 3. linux redirection output
when i ncdump -h a large file who have many variables, if i ncdump -h it in the logging window, i just see a part of variables. To solve this problem, i can redirect the output to a new file. <br>
such as (1)ncdump -h *.nc >& test.txt (2) vi test.txt <br>

>name means redirect output to file name.<br>
>&number means redirect output to file descriptor number.<br>

So the & is needed to tell the shell you mean a file descriptor, not a file name.<br>

A file descriptor is a number that refers to an already open file. The standard ones are 0 for standard input, 1 for standard output or 2 for standard error. You can also use any other number, which will create a new file descriptor, just like when you create a new variable with var=value.<br>

Example:
In case of >
eg. cat abc.txt > pqr.txt
The contents of pqr.txt will be replaced with that of abc.txt

In case of >>
eg. cat abc.txt >> pqr.txt
The contents of abc.txt will be appended with that pqr.txt at the end.
